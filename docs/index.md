## FAQ

- **_What happens if I run the uploader more than once?_**  
  If the name of an object has not been changed, the existing object will be updated in the database. If the name has
  been changed, a new object will be created and the old will remain.

- **_I entered a number into a cell but the uploader says the value is a string. What gives?_**  
  This is likely caused by the wrong value type being set for the given cell in the Excel document.

- **_What units can I use?_**  
  Here is a list of the <a href="https://github.com/hgrecco/pint/blob/master/pint/default_en.txt" target="_blank">
  supported units</a>
  from the Pint Python package.

- **_What if I have multiple measurements of the same thing?_**  
  You can use an `ID` field in front of row 2 to separate out the different measurements more on that in
  the <a href="excel rows/#id-optional">ID section of Row 2</a>

- **_How do I debug the errors when running the CRIP Excel Uploader?_**
  The best order to solve the issues is from the top down, as often many of the errors listed below are caused by the errors that appear at the top of the list.
