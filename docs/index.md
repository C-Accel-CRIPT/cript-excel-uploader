    Create an <b>Access Group</b> inside of the 
    <a href="https://www.criptapp.org/group" target="_blank">CRIPT platform</a>
    <ul>
      <li>
        An Access Group serves as permission control for the project. It represents an organization, institution, research group, or any grouping of users.
      </li>
      <li>
        An Access Group is needed because every Project must be owned by an Access Group
      </li>

    <a href="https://www.criptapp.org/project" target="_blank">CRIPT platform</a>
    <ul>
      <li>
      <!-- todo define project -->
      A Project can be thought of as a bunch of folders each containing experiments that contribute to a single project
      </li>
      <li>
        Essentially some Collections put in one bucket
      </li>
      <li>
        A Project is needed because each Collection belongs to a Project
      </li>
    </ul>

    Create a <b>Collection</b> inside the 
    <a href="https://www.criptapp.org/collection" target="_blank">CRIPT platform</a>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <!-- todo is this correct? -->
        A Collection can be thought of as a binder filled with experiments
      </li>
      <li>
      The entire <span style="color: #21a366">Excel</span> file will become a collection within the CRIPT Platform
      </li>
    </ul>

          The example_template_vX-X-X.xlsx can be used by users to directly record their data in the file
      </li>
      <li>
        Additionally, example_template_vX-X-X.xlsx can serve as an example excel file for users to get an idea on how to structure the excel files they may already have to conform with CRIPT

### <span id="relation-explanation" class="row-1"><b>relation</b></span> field in row 1 explained

The row 1 field <code>relation</code> is essentially a way for a row from one sheet to reference another row in a
different sheet.

In computer science terms, we could think of it as a foreign key type of relationship from the
<code>relation</code> row of one
sheet to the <code>\*name</code> row of another sheet, the name field works well as an identifier because we are
requiring names to be unique within a given sheet.

#### <u>Nesting Headers for each column in row 2</u>

<img src="./docs_assets/Screenshot_nested_row_column_header.png" style="margin-left: 3rem"
alt="Screenshot from Excel sheet column that shows multiple field headers">

- We can have more than one field present on a column header if needed
  - We can indicate that we are recording the `density` at a certain `temperature` by using a colon `":"` and notating
    it like this: `"density:temperature"`
  - Examples
    - Define a material property method: `density:method`
    - Associate data with a process condition `temperature:data`
    - Associate a citation with a material property: `density:citation`
    - Define material property condition: `density:temperature`
    - Define the uncertainty of a material property condition: `density:temperature:uncertainty`
      > `<field>:data` column values should derive from the `*name` column of the `Data` sheet.  
      > `<field>:citation` column values should derive from the `*name` column of the `Citation` sheet.

<br>

#### `Id` <span style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;"> - (optional)</span>

`Id` is used to allow for multiple measurements throughout time. With `Id` it is possible to take several measurements
through an experiment, and later use nesting to record more details.

If there are multiple densities throughout time, and we want to show each of their temperatures (or any other
condition) we can use an `Id` field to differentiate between the different temperatures. We denote an `Id` with brackets
and a number inside such as [1] or [2]. The `Id` is used to identify distinct properties/conditions of the same type

- e.g., To identify two density measurements at two different temperatures, we could create the following column
  headers: <span class="row-2">[1]density</span>, <span class="row-2">[1]density:temperature</span>
  , <span class="row-2">[2]density</span>, <span class="row-2">[2]density:temperature</span>

  <tr>

      property:condition

#### <u>Inputting list instead of a single value</u>

List values must use a semicolon **`;`** as a separator

Example:

<table>
  <tr class="row-1">

      category
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="row-2">

## FAQ

- **_What happens if I run the uploader more than once?_**  
  If the name of an object has not been changed, the existing object will be updated in the database. If the name has
  been changed, a new object will be created and the old will remain.

- **_I entered a number into a cell but the uploader says the value is a string. What gives?_**  
  This is likely caused by the wrong value type being set for the given cell in the Excel document.

- **_What units can I use?_**  
  Here is a list of the <a href="https://github.com/hgrecco/pint/blob/master/pint/default_en.txt" target="_blank">supported units</a>
  from the Pint Python package.
