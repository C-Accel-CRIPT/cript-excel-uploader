## <span id="relation-explanation" class="row-1"><b>relation</b></span> field in row 1 explained

The row 1 field <code>relation</code> is essentially a way for a row from one sheet to reference another row in a
different sheet.

In computer science terms, we could think of it as a foreign key type of relationship from the
<code>relation</code> row of one
sheet to the <code>\*name</code> row of another sheet, the name field works well as an identifier because we are
requiring names to be unique within a given sheet.

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Columns beginning with <code>*</code> are required (eg. <code>*name</code>)
    </li>
    <li>
      Columns beginning with <code>#</code> will be ignored (eg. <code>#storage</code>)
      <ul>
        <li>

### <u>Nesting Headers for each column in row 2</u>

<img src="../docs_assets/Screenshot_nested_row_column_header.png" style="margin-left: 3rem"
alt="Screenshot from Excel sheet column that shows multiple field headers">

- We can have more than one field present on a column header if needed
    - We can indicate that we are recording the `density` at a certain `temperature` by using a colon `":"` and notating
      it like this: `"density:temperature"`
    - Examples
        - Define a material property method: `density:method`
        - Associate data with a process condition `temperature:data`
        - Associate a citation with a material property: `density:citation`
        - Define material property condition: `density:temperature`
        - Define the uncertainty of a material property condition: `density:temperature:uncertainty`
          > `<field>:data` column values should derive from the `*name` column of the `Data` sheet.  
          > `<field>:citation` column values should derive from the `*name` column of the `Citation` sheet.

### `Id` <span style="color: grey; font-size: 0.8rem;"> - (optional)</span>

`Id` is used to allow for multiple measurements throughout time. With `Id` it is possible to take several measurements
through an experiment, and later use nesting to record more details.

If there are multiple densities throughout time, and we want to show each of their temperatures (or any other
condition) we can use an `Id` field to differentiate between the different temperatures. We denote an `Id` with brackets
and a number inside such as [1] or [2]. The `Id` is used to identify distinct properties/conditions of the same type

- e.g., To identify two density measurements at two different temperatures, we could create the following column
  headers: <span class="row-2">[1]density</span>, <span class="row-2">[1]density:temperature</span>
  , <span class="row-2">[2]density</span>, <span class="row-2">[2]density:temperature</span>

<br>

  <tr>
    <td class="row-1">

### <u>Inputting list instead of a single value</u>

List values must use a semicolon **`;`** as a separator

Example:

<table>
  <tr class="row-1">
    <td class="row-1">
      category
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="row-2">
      field name
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="row-3">
    <th class="row-3">
        units
    </th>
  </tr>
  <tr class="row-4">
    <td>
      funder 1; funder 2; funder 3; funder 4
    </td>
